## Challenge 6 - Deploying a VM with VNet
---

## Challenge
- Before you start to think about what a VM needs?
- Deploy a simple VNet (with subnet) - have you used child resources?
- Make sure you deploy Public IP with NSG - don't forget the dependency tree.
- Output the public FQDN address so that we can RDP.

## Success Criteria
- VNet and Subnet should be created.
- Public IP should be there and FQDN output and RDP into the machine - so NSG should work
